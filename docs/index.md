Xplore is a web app and mobile app campus-oriented platform  that allows students to discover, attend, or launch their own events in their college campus.

## Pain points solved by Xplore

- Event organisers need not post their events on social media platforms or multiple whatsapp groups.

- Students need not spend time searching for events and clubs and can get updates about events as early as possible.

- Institutions can keep a record of all the events going on and can award for explemplar performances.  

## Status

Right now the Xplore web and mobile is in development.
**Check out github issues to see what's being worked on.**


## How Xplore works - End user view

Xplore allows users to sign up with their unique college email id and password. Any Student can signup as a student or club. 

> You can always lanuch your own club later on and promote your account from Student to Club. However Student account can still launch their own events on their own or under a club that allows them to.

### Dashboards and Event Pages

After signing up, you will be redirected to the Student Dashboard or Club Dashboard, depending on your role.

This is the place where you can see your events, clubs, and interests. 

In the Explore tab you can find out the events that are happening in your college campus. You can also see the events that you have registered for.
