# Xplore - Discover, Attend, or Launch Your Own Events

Xplore Minimum Viable Product(MVP) is made on firebase PaaS. 

## What is ðŸ”¥ Firebase?  

Firebase is a backend platform by Google that helps developers build web and mobile apps faster.

It includes services like:

- Firestore / Realtime Database (databases)
- Authentication
- Hosting
- Cloud Functions
- Storage
- Analytics, etc.

You usually access Firebase through the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), SDKs, or CLI (firebase-tools).

## Why firebase for Xplore?

Xplore is in its very initial stages of development, using firebase helps not only in quick development but also help nullify the infrastructure cost. This is useful because Xplore can quickly iterate and improve based on feedback from its audience.

> Important: LDAP sign-in is not supported natively in firebase, however email based login system will be used initially and replaced with LDAP in the near future.
